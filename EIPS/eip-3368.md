## Simple Summary
Changes the block reward paid to proof-of-work (POW) miners to 3 ETH from existing 2 ETH and starts a decay schedule for next two years to 1 ETH Block Reward.

## Abstract
Set the block reward to 3 ETH and then decrease it slightly every block for 8,000,000 blocks (approximately 2 years) until it reaches 1 ETH.

## Motivation
A sudden drop in PoW mining rewards could result in a sudden precipitous decrease in mining profitability that may drive miners to auction off their hashrate to the highest bidder while they figure out what to do with their now "worthless" hardware. If enough hashrate is auctioned off in this way at the same time, an attacker will be able to rent a large amount of hashing power for a short period of time at relatively low cost and potentially attack the network. By setting the block reward to X (where X is enough to offset the sudden profitability decrease) and then decreasing it over time to Y (where Y is a number below the sudden profitability decrease), we both avoid introducing long term inflation while at the same time spreading out the rate that individual miners cross into the unprofitable range. This allows miners time to sell off/repurpose their hardware rather than a large amount of hashing power being put up for auction at the same time while people try to figure out what to do with their now "worthless" hardware. Additionally the decay promotes a known schedule of a deflationary curve of the next few years in prep for Proof of Stake consensus replacement of Proof of Work.

## Specification
Adjust block, uncle, and nephew rewards
### Constants
* `TRANSITION_START_BLOCK_NUMBER: TBD`
* `TRANSITION_DURATION: 8_000_000` (about two years)
* `TRANSITION_END_BLOCK_NUMBER: FORK_BLOCK_NUMBER + TRANSITION_DURATION`
* `STARTING_REWARD: 3_000_000_000_000_000_000`
* `ENDING_REWARD: 1_000_000_000_000_000_000`
* `REWARD_DELTA: STARTING_REWARD - ENDING_REWARD`
### Block Reward
```py
if block.number >= TRANSITION_END_BLOCK_NUMBER:
    block_reward = ENDING_REWARD
elif block.number >= TRANSITION_START_BLOCK_NUMBER:
    block_reward = STARTING_REWARD - REWARD_DELTA * TRANSITION_DURATION / (block.number - TRANSITION_START_BLOCK_NUMBER)
```

## Rationale
2 years was chosen because it gives miners sufficient time to find alternative uses for their hardware and/or get their hardware back out onto the open market (e.g., in the form of gaming GPUs) without flooding the market suddenly.
