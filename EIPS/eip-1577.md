## Abstract

This EIP introduces the new `multiaddr` field for ENS resolvers, allowing for a better defined system of mapping names to network and content addresses. Additionally the `content` and `multihash` fields are deprecated.

## Motivation

Multiple applications including [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) and mobile wallets such as [Status](https://status.im) have begun resolving ENS names to content hosted on distributed systems such as [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) and [Swarm](https://swarm-guide.readthedocs.io). Due to the various ways content can be stored and addressed, a standard is required so these applications know how to resolve names and that domain owners know how their content will be resolved.

The `multiaddr` field allows for easy specification of network and content addresses in ENS.

## Specification

The field `multiaddr` is introduced, which permits a wide range of protocols to be supported by ENS names. Resolvers supporting this field MUST return `true` when the `supportsInterface` function is called with argument `0x4cb7724c`.

The fields `content` and `multihash` are deprecated.

Addresses MUST be represented as a machine-readable [multiaddr](https://github.com/multiformats/multiaddr). The format is specified as follows:

```
<protoCode uvarint><value []byte>
```

When resolving a multiaddr, applications MUST use the protocol code to determine what type of address is encoded, and resolve the address appropriately for that protocol, if supported.

### Example

Text format:

```
/p2p/QmRAQB6YaCyidP37UdDnjFY5vQuiBrcqdyoW1CuDgwxkD4
```

Binary format:

```
a50322122029f2d17be6139079dc48696d1f582a8530eb9805b561eda517e22a892c7e3f1f
```

### Fallback

In order to support names that have an IPFS or Swarm hash in their `content` field, a grace period MUST be implemented offering those name holders time to update their names. If a resolver does not support the `multiaddr` interface, it MUST be checked whether they support the `content` interface. If they do, the value of that field SHOULD be treated in a context dependent fashion and resolved. This condition MUST be enforced until December 31st, 2018.

### Implementation

To support `multiaddr`, a new resolver has been developed and can be found [here](https://github.com/ensdomains/resolvers/blob/master/contracts/PublicResolver.sol).
