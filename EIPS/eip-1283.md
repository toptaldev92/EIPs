## Abstract

This EIP proposes net gas metering changes for SSTORE opcode, as an
alternative for EIP-1087. It tries to be friendlier to implementations
that uses different opetimiazation strategies for storage change
caches.

## Motivation

EIP-1087 proposes a way to adjust gas metering for SSTORE opcode,
enabling new usages on this opcodes where it is previously too
expensive. However, EIP-1087 requires keeping a dirty map for storage
changes, and implictly makes the assumption that a transaction's
storage changes are committed to the storage trie at the end of a
transaction. This works well for some implementations, but not for
others. After EIP-658, an efficient storage cache implementation would
probably use an in-memory trie (without RLP encoding/decoding) or
other immutable data structures to keep track of storage changes, and
only commit changes at the end of a block. For them, it is possible to
know a storage's original value and current value, but it is not
possible to iterate over all storage changes without incur additional
memory or processing costs.

This EIP proposes an alternative way for gas metering on SSTORE, using
information that is more universially available to most
implementations:

* *Storage slot's original value*.
* *Storage slot's current value*. 
* Refund counter.

We provided two possible specification versions here.

* For both of the two versions, we don't suffer from the optimization
  limitation of EIP-1087, and it never costs more gases compared with
  current scheme.
* For Version I, it covers most common usages, and we have two edge
  cases it do not cover, one of which may potentially be useful.
* For Version II, it covers nearly all usages for a transient
  storage. We only have one rare edge case (resetting a storage back
  to its original value and then set it again) not covered. Clients
  that are easy to implement EIP-1087 will also be easy to implement
  Version II. Some other clients might require a little bit extra
  refactoring on this. Nonetheless, no extra memory or processing cost
  is needed on runtime.

Usages that benefits from this EIP's gas reduction scheme includes:

* Subsequent storage write operations within the same call frame. This
  includes reentry locks, same-contract multi-send, etc.
* Passing storage information from sub call frame to parent call
  frame, where this information does not need to be persistent outside
  of a transaction. This includes sub-frame error codes and message
  passing, etc.
* Passing storage information from parent call frame to sub call
  frame, where this information does not need to be persistent outside
  of a transaction. This is covered by Version II but not Version I.

## Specification (Version I)

Definitions of terms are as below:

* *Storage slot's original value*: This is the value of the storage if
  a call/create reversion happens on the *current VM execution
  context*.
* *Storage slot's current value*: This is the value of the storage
  before SSTORE operation happens.
* *Storage slot's new value*: This is the value of the storage after
  SSTORE operation happens.

Replace SSTORE opcode gas cost calculation (including refunds) with
the following logic:

* If *current value* equals *new value* (this is a no-op), 200 gas is
  deducted.
* If *current value* does not equal *new value*
  * If *original value* equals *current value* (this storage slot has
    not been changed by the current execution context)
    * If *original value* is 0, 20000 gas is deducted.
    * Otherwise, 5000 gas is deducted. If *new value* is 0, add 15000
      gas to refund counter.
  * If *original value* does not equal *current value* (this storage
    slot is dirty), 200 gas is deducted. Apply both of the following
    clauses.
    * If *original value* is not 0
      * If *current value* is 0 (also means that *new value* is not
        0), remove 15000 gas from refund counter. We can prove that
        refund counter will never go below 0.
      * If *new value* is 0 (also means that *current value* is not
        0), add 15000 gas to refund counter.
    * If *original value* equals *new value* (this storage slot is
      reset)
      * If *original value* is 0, add 19800 gas to refund counter.
      * Otherwise, add 4800 gas to refund counter.

Refund counter works as before -- it is limited to half of the gas
consumed.

## Specification (Version II)

The same as Version I, except we change the definition of *original
value* to:

* *Storage slot's original value*: This is the value of the storage if
  a reversion happens on the *current transaction*.

## Explanation

The new gas cost scheme for SSTORE is divided to three different
types:

* **No-op**: the virtual machine does not need to do anything. This is
  the case if *current value* equals *new value*.
* **Fresh**: this storage slot has not been changed, or has been reset
  to its original value either on current frame, or on a sub-call
  frame for the same contract. This is the case if *current value*
  does not equal *new value*, and *original value* equals *current
  value*.
* **Dirty**: this storage slot has already been changed, either on
  current frame or on a sub-call frame for the same contract. This is
  the case if *current value* does not equal *new value*, and
  *original value* does not equal *current value*.

We can see that the above three types cover all possible variations of
*original value*, *current value*, and *new value*.

**No-op** is a trivial operation. Below we only consider cases for
**Fresh** and **Dirty**.

All initial (not-**No-op**) SSTORE on a particular storage slot starts
with **Fresh**. After that, it will become **Dirty** if the value has
been changed (either on current call frame or a sub-call frame for the
same contract). When going from **Fresh** to **Dirty**, we charge the
gas cost the same as current scheme.

For Version I, when entering a sub-call frame, a previously-marked
**Dirty** storage slot will again become **Fresh**, but only for this
sub-call frame. Note that we don't charge any more gases compared with
current scheme in this case.

In current call frame, a **Dirty** storage slot can be reset back to
**Fresh** via a SSTORE opcode either on current call frame or a
sub-call frame. For current call frame, this dirtiness is tracked, so
we can issue refunds. For Version I's sub-call frame, it is not
possible to track this dirtiness reset, so the refunds (for *current
call frame*'s initial SSTORE from **Fresh** to **Dirty**) are not
issued. For Version II's sub-call frame, This refund is tracked and
properly issued. In the case where refunds are not issued, the gas
cost is the same as the current scheme.

When a storage slot remains at **Dirty**, we charge 200 gas. In this
case, we would also need to keep track of `R_SCLEAR` refunds -- if we
already issued the refund but it no longer applies (*current value* is
0), then removes this refund from the refund counter. If we didn't
issue the refund but it applies now (*new value* is 0), then adds this
refund to the refund counter. It is not possible where a refund is not
issued but we remove the refund in the above case, because all storage
slot starts with **Fresh** state, either on current call frame or a
sub-call frame.

### State Transition

Below is a graph ([by
@Arachnid](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/1283#issuecomment-410229053))
showing possible state transition of gas costs. Note that for Version
I, this applies to current call frame only, and we ignore **No-op**
state because that is trivial:

![State Transition](../assets/eip-1283/state.png)

Below are table version of the above diagram. Vertical shows the *new
value* being set, and horizontal shows the state of *original value*
and *current value*.

When *original value* is 0:

|    | A (`current=orig=0`) | B (`current!=orig`)      |
|----|----------------------|--------------------------|
| ~0 | B; 20k gas           | B; 200 gas               |
| 0  | A; 200 gas           | A; 200 gas, 19.8k refund |

When *original value* is not 0:

|             | X (`current=orig!=0`) | Y (`current!=orig`)     | Z (`current=0`)           |
|-------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| `orig`      | X; 200 gas            | X; 200 gas, 4.8k refund | X; 200 gas, -10.2k refund |
| `~orig, ~0` | Y; 5k gas             | Y; 200 gas              | Y; 200 gas, -15k refund   |
| 0           | Z; 5k gas, 15k refund | Z; 200 gas, 15k refund  | Z; 200 gas                |

## Rationale

This EIP mostly archives what a transient storage tries to do
(EIP-1087 and EIP-1153), but without the complexity of introducing the
concept of "dirty maps", or an extra storage struct. One limitation is
that for some edge cases dirtiness will not be tracked:

* For Version I, the first SSTORE for a storage slot on a sub-call
  frame for the same contract won't benefit from gas reduction. For
  Version II, this type of gas reduction is properly tracked and
  applied.
* If a storage slot is changed, and it's reset to its original
  value. The next SSTORE to the same storage slot won't benefit from
  gas reduction.

Examine examples provided in EIP-1087's Motivation:

* If a contract with empty storage sets slot 0 to 1, then back to 0,
  it will be charged `20000 + 200 - 19800 = 400` gas.
* A contract with empty storage that increments slot 0 5 times will be
  charged `20000 + 5 * 200 = 21000` gas.
* A balance transfer from account A to account B followed by a
  transfer from B to C, with all accounts having nonzero starting and
  ending balances
  * If the token contract has multi-send function, it will cost
    `5000 * 3 + 200 - 4800 = 10400` gas.
  * If this transfer from A to B to C is invoked by a third-party
    contract, and the token contract has no multi-send function, then
    it won't benefit from this EIP's gas reduction.

## Backwards Compatibility

This EIP requires a hard fork to implement. No gas cost increase is
anticipated, and many contract will see gas reduction.

## Test Cases

To be added.
