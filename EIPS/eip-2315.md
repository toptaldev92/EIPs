## Abstract

This proposal introduces three opcodes to support subroutines:  `BEGINSUB`, `JUMPSUB` and `RETURNSUB`.

## Motivation

The EVM does not provide subroutines as a primitive.  Instead, calls can be synthesized by fetching and pushing the current program counter on the data stack and jumping to the subroutine address; returns can be synthesized by contriving to get the return address back to the top of stack and jumping back to it.  Complex calling conventions are then needed to use the same stack for computation and control flow.  Code becomes harder to read and write, and tools may need to pattern-match the conventions to identify the use of subroutines.  Complex calling conventions like these can be avoided using memory, but regardless, it costs a lot of gas.

Having opcodes to directly support subroutines can eliminate this complexity and cost, just as for other physical and virtual machines going back at least 50 years.

In the Appendix we show example solc output for a simple program that uses over three times as much gas just calling and returning from subroutines as comparable code using these opcodes.

## Specification

##### `BEGINSUB`
Marks the entry point to a subroutine.

##### `JUMPSUB`
Jumps to the destination address on top of the stack, which must be the offset of a `BEGINSUB`.

##### `RETURNSUB`
Returns to the most recently executed `JUMPSUB` and advances to the following instruction.

A program may `JUMPSUB` at most 1023 times without an intervening `RETURNSUB`.  A program which executes `RETURNSUB` without no prior `BEGINSUB` will `STOP`.

## Rationale

This is the smallest possible change that provides native subroutines without breaking backwards compatibility.

## Backwards Compatibility

These changes do not affect the semantics of existing EVM code.

## Test Cases
```
                      data  return
offset step opcode    stack stack
0      0    PUSH1 3   []    []
1      1    JUMPSUB   [3]   [1]
2      4    STOP      []    [1]
3      2    BEGINSUB  []    [1]
4      3    RETURNSUB []    []
```
The above code should terminate after 4 steps with an empty stack.
```
                      data  return
offset step opcode    stack stack
0      0    PUSH1 2   []    []
1      1    JUMPSUB   [2]   [1]
2      2    BEGINSUB  []    [1]
3      3    RETURNSUB []    []
```
The above code should terminate after 4 steps with an empty stack.
```
                      data  return
offset step opcode    stack stack
0      0    PUSH1 3   []    []
1      1    JUMPSUB   [3]   [1]
2      8    STOP      []    []
3      2    BEGINSUB  []    [1]
4      3    PUSH1 7   []    [1]
5      4    JUMPSUB   [7]   [1,5]
6      7    RETURNSUB []    [1]
7      5    BEGINSUB  []    [1]
8      6    RETURNSUB []    [1]
```
The above code should terminate after 8 steps with an empty stack.  The above code should terminate after 8 steps with an empty stack.

## Implementations

No clients have implemented this proposal as of yet, but there are Draft PRs on the [evmone](https://github.com/ethereum/evmone/pull/229) and [geth](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/20619) interpreters.

The new operators proposed here are demonstrated by the following pseudocode, which adds a return stack and cases for `BEGINSUB`, `JUMPSUB` and `RETURNSUB` to a simple loop-and-switch interpreter.
```
bytecode[code_size]
data_stack[1024] = { }
return_stack[1024] = { code_size }
PC = 0
while PC < code_size {
   opcode = bytecode[PC]
   switch opcode {
   ...
   case BEGINSUB:
   
   case JUMPSUB:
      push(return_stack, PC)
      PC = pop(data_stack)
      continue

   case RETURNSUB:
      PC = pop(return_stack)
   }
   ++PC
}
```
Execution of EVM bytecode begins with one value on the return stackâ€”the size of the bytecode. The implicit 0 bytes at and after this offset are EVM `STOP` opcods.  So executing a `RETURNSUB` with no prior `JUMPSUB` jumps to the _code_size_ offset on the stack, then executes a `STOP` on the next cycle.  A `STOP` or `RETURN` ends the execution of the program.

### Costs and Codes

We suggest that the cost of `BEGINSUB` be _base_, `JUMPSUB` be _low_, and `RETURNSUB` be _verylow_. 
 Measurement will tell.  We suggest the following opcodes:

```
0xb2 BEGINSUB
0xb3 JUMPSUB
0xb7 RETURNSUB
```
## Security Considerations

Program flow analysis frameworks will need to be updated to allow for a new type of branch - `JUMPSUB` - which will cause a jump to a destination which is a `BEGINSUB`, not a `JUMPDEST`.

## Appendix: Comparative costs.

```
contract fun {
    function test(uint x, uint y) public returns (uint) {
        return test_mul(2,3);
    }
    function test_mul(uint x, uint y) public returns (uint) {
        return multiply(x,y);
    }
    function multiply(uint x, uint y) public returns (uint) {
        return x * y;
    }
}

```
Here is solc 0.6.3 assembly code with labeled destinations.
```
TEST:
     jumpdest
     0x00
     RTN
     0x02
     0x03
     TEST_MUL
     jump
TEST_MUL:
     jumpdest
     0x00
     RTN
     dup4
     dup4
     MULTIPLY
     jump
RTN:
     jumpdest
     swap4
     swap3
     pop
     pop
     pop
     jump
MULTIPLY:   
     jumpdest
     mul
     swap1
     jump
```
solc does a good job with the multiply() function, which is a leaf.  Non-leaf functions are more awkward to get out of.  Calling `fun.test()` will cost _118 gas_, plus 5 for the `mul`.

  This is the same code written using `jumpsub` and `returnsub`.  Calling `fun.test()` will cost _34 gas_ (plus 5).
```
TEST:
     beginsub
     0x02
     0x03
     TEST_MUL
     jumpsub
     returnsub
TEST_MUL:
     beginsub
     MULTIPLY
     jumpsub
     returnsub
MULTIPLY:
     beginsub
     mul
     returnsub
```
