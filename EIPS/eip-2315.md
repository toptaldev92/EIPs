## Abstract

This proposal introduces two opcodes to support subroutines:  `JUMPSUB` and `RETURNSUB`.

## Motivation

The EVM does not provide subroutines as a primitive.  Instead, calls must be synthesized by fetching and pushing the current program counter on the data stack and jumping to the subroutine address; returns must be synthesized by getting the return address to the top of stack and jumping back to it.

## Specification

##### `JUMPSUB`
Jumps to the address on top of the stack, which must be the offset of a `JUMPDEST`.

##### `RETURNSUB`
Returns to the most recently executed `JUMPSUB` and advances to the following instruction.

A program may `JUMPSUB` at most 1023 times without an intervening `RETURNSUB`.  A program which executes `RETURNSUB` without no prior `BEGINSUB` will `STOP`.

## Rationale

This is the smallest possible change that provides native subroutines without breaking backwards compatibility.

## Backwards Compatibility

These changes do not affect the semantics of existing EVM code.

## Test Cases
```
                      data  return
offset step opcode    stack stack
0      0    PUSH1 3   []    []
1      1    JUMPSUB   [3]   [1]
2      4    STOP      []    [1]
3      2    JUMPDEST  []    [1]
4      3    RETURNSUB []    []
```
The above code should terminate after 4 steps with an empty stack.
```
                      data  return
offset step opcode    stack stack
0      0    PUSH1 2   []    []
1      1    JUMPSUB   [2]   [1]
2      2    JUMPDEST  []    [1]
3      3    RETURNSUB []    []
```
The above code should terminate after 4 steps with an empty stack.
```
                      data  return
offset step opcode    stack stack
0      0    PUSH1 3   []    []
1      1    JUMPSUB   [3]   [1]
2      8    STOP      []    []
3      2    JUMPDEST  []    [1]
4      3    PUSH1 7   []    [1]
5      4    JUMPSUB   [7]   [1,5]
6      7    RETURNSUB []    [1]
7      5    JUMPDEST  []    [1]
8      6    RETURNSUB []    [1]
```
The above code should terminate after 8 steps with an empty stack.  The above code should terminate after 8 steps with an empty stack.

## Implementations

No clients have implemented this proposal as of yet, but there are Draft PRs on the [evmone](https://github.com/ethereum/evmone/pull/229) and [geth](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/20619) interpreters.

The new operators proposed here are demonstrated by the following pseudocode, which in seven lines adds a return stack and cases for `JUMPSUB` and `RETURNSUB` to a simple loop-and-switch interpreter.
```
bytecode[code_size]
data_stack[1024] = { }
return_stack[1024] = { code_size }
PC = 0
while PC < code_size {
   opcode = bytecode[PC]
   switch opcode {
   ...
   case JUMPSUB:
      push(return_stack, PC)
      PC = pop(data_stack)
      continue
   case RETURNSUB:
      PC = pop(return_stack)
   }
   ++PC
}
```
Execution of EVM bytecode begins with one value on the return stackâ€”the size of the bytecode. The implicit 0 bytes at and after this offset are EVM `STOP` opcods.  So executing a `RETURNSUB` with no prior `JUMPSUB` jumps to the _code_size_ offset on the stack, then executes a `STOP` on the next cycle.  A `STOP` or `RETURN` ends the execution of the program.

### Costs and Codes

We suggest the cost of `JUMPSUB` should be _low_, and `RETURNSUB` should be _verylow_. 
 Measurement will tell.  We suggest the following opcodes:
```
0xb3 JUMPSUB
0xb7 RETURNSUB
```
## Security Considerations

Program flow analysis frameworks will need to be updated to allow for a new type of branch -`JUMPSUB` - and new type of branching - `RETURNSUB` - which will cause a jump to a destination which is a `JUMPSUB`, not a `JUMPDEST`.
