## Abstract

This proposal introduces two opcodes to support subroutines:  `JUMPSUB` and `RETURNSUB`.

## Motivation

The EVM does not provide subroutines as a primitive.  Instead, calls must be synthesized by fetching and pushing the current program counter on the data stack and jumping to the subroutine address; returns must be synthesized by getting the return address to the top of stack and jumping back to it.

## Specification

##### `JUMPSUB`
Jumps to the address on top of the stack, which must be the offset of a `JUMPDEST`.

##### `RETURNSUB`
Returns to the most recently executed `JUMPSUB` and executes the following instruction.

A program may `JUMPSUB` at most 1023 times without an intervening `RETURNSUB`.  A program which executes `RETURNSUB` without no prior `BEGINSUB` will `STOP`.

## Rationale

This is the smallest possible change that provides native subroutines without breaking backwards compatibility.

## Backwards Compatibility

These changes do not affect the semantics of existing EVM code.

## Test Cases
```
step op       stack
0    PUSH1 3   []
1    JUMPSUB   [3]
4    STOP      []
2    JUMPDEST  []
3    RETURNSUB []
```
This code should terminate after 4 steps with an empty stack.

## Implementations

No clients have implemented this proposal as of yet.

The new operators proposed here are implemented by the following pseudocode, which adds cases for `JUMPSUB` and `RETURNSUB` to a simple loop-and-switch interpreter.
```
bytecode[code_size]
data_stack[1024]
return_stack[1024]
PC = 0
push(return_stack, PC)
loop: while PC < code_size {
   opcode = bytecode[PC]
   switch opcode {
   ...
   case JUMPSUB:
      push(return_stack, PC)
      PC = pop(data_stack)
      continue loop
   case RETURNSUB:
      PC = pop(return_stack)
   }
   ++PC
}
```
Execution of EVM bytecode begins with one value on the return stackâ€”the size of the bytecode. The virtual byte of 0 at this offset is the EVM `STOP` opcode, so executing a `RETURNSUB` with no prior `JUMPSUB` executes a `STOP`.  A `STOP` or `RETURN` ends the execution of the subroutine and the program.

### Costs and Codes

We suggest the cost of `JUMPSUB` should be _low_, and `RETURNSUB` should be _verylow_. 
 Measurement will tell.  We suggest the following opcodes:
```
0xb3 JUMPSUB
0xb7 RETURNSUB
```
## Security Considerations

Program flow analysis frameworks will need to be updated to allow for a new type of branch -`JUMPSUB` - and new type of branching - `RETURNSUB` will cause a jump to a destination which is 
a `JUMPSUB`, not a `JUMPDEST`.
