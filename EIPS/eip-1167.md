## Simple Summary
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the EIP.-->
To simply and cheaply clone contract functionality in an immutable way, we propose to standardize on a minimal bytecode implementation which delegates all calls to a known, fixed address.  
## Abstract
<!--A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.-->
By standardizing on a known minimal bytecode redirect implementation, this standard will allow users and third party tools (e.g. Etherscan) to (a) simply discover that a contract will always redirect in a known manner and (b) depend on the behavior of the code at the destination contract as the behavior of the redirecting contract.  Specifically, tooling can interrogate the bytecode at a redirecting address to determine the location of the code that will run - and can depend on representations about that code (verified source, third-party audits, etc).  We have an implementation we believe to be minimal and covering both standard calls and 


## Motivation
<!--The motivation is critical for EIPs that want to change the Ethereum protocol. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the EIP solves. EIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->
This standard is desireable to allow for use-cases wherein it is desireable to clone exact contract functionality with a minimum of side effects (e.g. memory slot stomping) and with super-cheap deployment of duplicate proxies.

## Specification
<!--The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current Ethereum platforms (go-ethereum, parity, cpp-ethereum, ethereumj, ethereumjs, and [others](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Clients)).-->
The exact bytecode of the standard clone contract is this: `6000368180378080368173bebebebebebebebebebebebebebebebebebebebe5af43d82803e15602c573d90f35b3d90fd` wherein the bytes at idices 10 - 29 (inclusive) are replaced with the 20 byte address of the master functionality contract.  The reference implementation of this is found at the [optionality/clone-factory](https://github.com/optionality/clone-factory) github repo.  There are variations as well for using vanity contract addresses with leading zeros to further shrink the necessary clone bytecode (thus making it cheaper to deploy).  Detection of clone and redirection is implemented in the clone-factory repo with a contract deployed on both Kovan and Mainnet that detects the presence of a clone and returns the destination address if the interrogated contract is a clone (handles shortened addresses as well).

## Rationale
<!--The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->
The goals of this effort have been the following:
- inexpensive deployment (low gas to deploy clones)
- support clone initialization in creation transaction (through factory contract model)
- simple clone bytecode to encourage directly bytecode interrogation (see CloneProbe.sol in the clone-factory project)
- dependable, locked-down behavior - this is not designed to handle upgradability, nor should it as the representation we are seeking is stronger.
- small operational overhead - adds a single call cost to each call
- handles error return bubbling for revert messages

## Backwards Compatibility
<!--All EIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The EIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. EIP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.-->
There are no backwards compatibility issues.

## Test Cases
<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for EIPs that are affecting consensus changes. Other EIPs can choose to include links to test cases if applicable.-->
We have included some simple test cases in the clone-factory project that demonstrate the function of this contract including the error handling and error message propagation.

## Implementation
<!--The implementations must be completed before any EIP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the EIP is accepted. While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.-->
