## Simple Summary
Defines a new transaction type that is an envelope for future transaction types.

## Abstract
As of `FORK_BLOCK_NUMBER`, `rlp([TransactionType, Payload])` will be a valid transaction where `TransactionType` is a number identifying the format of the transaction and `payload` is the transaction, whose definition is defined in future EIPs.  The first new transaction type will be a wrapped legacy transaction with the format `rlp([0, rlp([nonce, gasPrice, gasLimit, to, value, data, v, r, s])])`.

## Motivation
In the past, when we have wanted to add new transaction types we have had to ensure they were backward compatible with all other transactions, meaning that you could differentiate them based only on the encoded payload, and it was not possible to have a transaction that matched both types.  This was seen in [EIP-155](./eip-155.md) where the new value was bit-packed into one of the encoded fields.  There are multiple proposals in discussion that define new transaction types such as one that allows EOA accounts to execute code directly within their context, one that enables someone besides `msg.sender` to pay for gas, and proposals related to layer 0 multi-sig transactions.  These all need to be defined in a way that is mutually compatible, which quickly becomes burdensome to EIP authors and to clients who now have to follow complex rules for differentiating transaction type.

By introducing an envolope transaction type, we only need to ensure backward compatibility with existing transactions and from then on we just need to solve the much simpler problem of ensuring there is no numbering conflict between `TransactionType`s.

## Specification
As of `FORK_BLOCK_NUMBER`, `rlp([nonce, gasPrice, gasLimit, to, value, data, v, r, s])` (legacy transaction) will no longer be a valid Ethereum transaction over the devp2p protocol or in a block.

As of `FORK_BLOCK_NUMBER`, all transactions sent over devp2p or included in a block **MUST** be of the form `rlp([TransactionType, Payload])` where `TransactionType` is a number that represents the type of the transcation and `Payload` is an opaque value (byte array) whose interpretation is dependent on the `TransactionType`.  Transactions **SHOULD** include the `TransactionType` in any signatures they include to minimize the chance of unintentional replay attacks between different transaction types.

As of `FORK_BLOCK_NUMBER`, `rlp([0, rlp([nonce, gasPrice, gasLimit, to, value, data, v, r, s])])` will be a valid transaction where the `Payload` will be processed/handled exactly the same as legacy transactions were processed/handled.

As of `FORK_BLOCK_NUMBER`, the EVM opcode `0x32` (aka: `ORIGIN`, aka: `tx.origin`) will be colloquially renamed to `TRANSACTION_DATA`.  The high 32-bits of the value will be the `TransactionType`, and the low 224-bits will be transaction type dependent.  For `TransactionType` `0`, the low 224-bits will be the address recovered from the signature represented by `v, r, s`.

As of `FORK_BLOCK_NUMBER`, the EVM opcode `0x33` (aka: `CALLER`, aka: `msg.sender`) will have its value for the initial call frame be determined by the transaction type.  The high 32-bits of the value will be the `TransactionType`, and the low 224-bits will be transaction type dependent.  For `TransactionType` `0`, the low 224-bits will be the address recovered from the signature represented by `v, r, s`.

## Rationale
### TransactionType high bit
Setting the high bit of the `TransactionType` so that a decoder could identify transaction type early on in the decoding process was discussed, but decided against.  The problem with this solution is that due to the way RLP encoding works, this would result in the `TransactionType` being 5 bytes long rather than 1 byte long.  RLP decoders also do not need to know the shape of the result before decoding, and thus in most (possibly all) clients it will be just be a matter of first decoding the RLP transaction, and then checking to see if the decoded result is a 2 item array or a 9 item array, which is likely simpler than checking the high bit of the first item.
### TransactionType selection algorithm
There was discussion about defining the `TransactionType` identifier assignment/selection algorithm in this standard.  While it would be nice to have a standardized mechanism for assignment, at the time of writing of this standard there is not a strong need for it so it was deemed out of scope.  A future EIP may introduce a standard for TransactionType identifier assignment if it is deemed necessary.
### Opaque second item rather than an array
By having the second item of the array just be opaque bytes, rather than a list, we can support different encoding formats for the transaction payload in the future, such as SSZ or a fixed width format.
### `n`-item list instead of 2-item list
We could have chosen the format `rlp([TransactionType, ...])` where `...` represents whatever items the transaction wants.  This format however would require us to remain vigilant in the future about using the shape of the transaction to identify its type, as it is possible that there could be an overlap between an EIP-2718 transaction type and a legacy transaction type with a nonce that matches the `TransactionType`.  By having a strict 2-item array with the second item potentially being an encoded list, we avoid needing to worry about any conflict between TransactionTypes beyond choosing uinque numbers.
### ORIGIN and CALLER Change
With the advent of multiple transaction types, it is possible that future transactions will not have an origin or caller that aligns well with the current concept of ORIGIN and CALLER.  For example, a multisig transaction may have two recovered addresses or a sponsored transaction may have a separate caller and a gas payer.  By having the high 32 bits be the transaction type, we can ensure backward compatibility with legacy transactions which use only the low 160-bits of the `ORIGIN` and `CALLER` by having the high bits be `0` for that transaction type.  At the same time, we open the doors for future transaction types to define what `CALLER` and `ORIGIN` should be set to in ways that make sense for each transaction type.

## Backwards Compatibility
Clients can differentiate between the transaction types by noting that the RLP decoded transaction has 2 elements rather than 9 or by noting that the second element is a list rather than a value.

## Test Cases
TBD

## Implementation
TBD

## Security Considerations
Due to the way RLP encoding works, the risk of a new transaction being mis-interpreted as a legacy transaction is deemed low.  The authors of this EIP consider it unlikely that there are any transaction decoders in production that will accept a transaction with not enough elements (perhaps reading off the end of the array), or read the second item as a value when it is encoded as an array.
